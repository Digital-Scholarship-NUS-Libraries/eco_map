					<h2>The Great Drought of 1877</h2>
					<p>The Great Drought of 1877
						In 1877, Singapore suffered a drought of exceptional magnitude. Crossing ten months from February to late November, the normal inter-monsoon period of dry weather interspersed with severe thunderstorms (March to May) and the Southwest monsoon (June to September) never materialised. Rainfall fell to some of the lowest levels since rainfall records had started to be kept consistently in 1869 at 65.14 inches for the year. To put this into perspective, a modern average annual rainfall (1981-2010) is just over 85 ins, thus 1877 was not only much lower overall than what might be considered normal, but it was also concentrated around the early part of the year and late December. The drought’s natural instigator was the El Niño phase of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), but it was made a disaster by insufficient water reserves and water management in the rapidly growing town. Most inhabitants relied on an antiquated system of wells, tanks and small reservoirs situated in and around the town centre for their water, despite some investment in improving the clean water infrastructure by the municipal government. Piped water to domestic dwellings was a privilege only for the wealthy and the system of ceramic underground piping for water and for drainage then commonplace in many British cities had not been adopted in Singapore. In desperation, even pseudo-scientific theories were discussed (though not enacted) to trigger rain, including cannonading using artillery and gunpowder held at the garrison at Fort Canning (Straits Times Overland Journal, 28 April 1877, p. 7). The drought continued into the autumn, bringing with it sporadic outbreaks of cholera and the loss of many important plant species at the botanic gardens. Fires were common and feared. In Singapore during November, for example, a major fire started in the grounds of a bungalow in the wealthy European Tanglin area, caused by a stray spark in the lalang (weeds) which were ‘dry as tinder owing to the prolonged drought’ (The Straits Times, 24 November 1877). The drought finally ended in the December, around the same time as the new Impounding Reservoir was opened (MacRitchie Reservoir). It was hoped that the new facility would bring an end to Singapore’s water problems in the future.
